Do you have an idea you want to turn into a side project?
Are you itching to try new APIs or tech you've heard but haven't worked on?
Are you looking to hone your portfolio or connect to some professionals in the tech space?

Well, we're here for you! UNIHACK, the go-to Australian hackathon for university students, is kicking off for the first time in Sydney at Stone & Chalk in August 19 to 20!

The premise is simple - student teams (max 6) have 24 hours to design and build something awesome. It can be anything - a website, a mobile application, a video game, or even something hardware-related. The important thing is that you present a technical prototype to the judges. We welcome all university students - undergrads and postgrads to come and join in the fun.

In addition to free food and drinks, we have these activities lined up:

1. Careers Fair - We've invited companies to talk about opportunities (e.g., internships, graduate programs, and courses).
2. Workshops - Tech, design and how-to-pitch talks to get students ready to go. 
3. Idea/Pitch Validation - Get some advice on how to build your idea and some pitching practice before the clock runs out.
4. Hackathon - 24 hours of thinking, designing and building the next big thing!
5. Expo - Public expo for all teams to live demo their prototype to judges, mentors and guests.
6. Prize presentations - $3000, $1500 and $800 are the top 3 prizes up for grabs, with more to be revealed soon.

Come and join in the fun, we can't wait to see what you can build!
